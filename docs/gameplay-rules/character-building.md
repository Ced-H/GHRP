# Character Building

It is recommended at all times to have a character story. This helps maintain realism and provide an enjoyable RP for all. This can be done through the following:

__Characteristics & Traits__

Character traits help create a personality for whom you are playing, and help depict what acts you will and won't commit, Examples of Traits:

!!! success "Good Traits"
    - Loyalty
    - Kindness
    - Integrity
    - Generosity
    - Self-control
    - Patience
    - Tolerance

    __Dark Traits__
   
    - Rudeness
    - Greed
    - Selfishness
    - Unforgiving

__Character's Purpose__

Your character should have a purpose in life with a consistent or developing story.

Example: Don't have a single character who is simultaneously the CEO of a company and a homeless drug user.

__Story__

Develop your character over time, start off with small things, whether your character has good or dark traits. Work your way up to bigger and better things, rather than doing major jumps in a couple of hours. Developing your character helps create a history within the CAD System and a known/recognized name around Hall County. This is crucial for realism. 

Examples:

!!! success "Subject A"

    Is a positive guy he moves to San Andreas with 1000$ in his pocket, he makes a roadside mechanic shop and daily went to work, due to his positive vibe a lot of customers came and got jobs done from him. After a couple of months, he gained enough money from profit in his roadside mechanic shop and leased out a building off of Route 68, continuing to develop his career as a mechanic.

!!! failure "Subject B"

    Starts to run a dealership in Gainesville from the money he invented, he then starts to kill his customers if they have blonde hair, eventually becoming a serial killer. But at the same time he becomes a chef at a restaurant and poisons people, he robs shops and banks during his spare time and even robbed his own dealership.

!!! warning "Suicide RP"

    Should be a decision/story which is developed over time. It cannot be used to escape from RP.
