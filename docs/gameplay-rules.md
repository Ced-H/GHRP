## Overview

Welcome to Georgia HEAT Roleplay, "GHRP". We are a semi-realistic FiveM server, but we expect a high level of roleplay. This document lists the rules and guidelines for roleplay, which should be followed to the best of your ability at all times. Failure to meet roleplay expectations as outlined in this document will result in discipline to protect each community members experience. 

Not all rules can be outlined, but you should approach in game interactions with common sense. Your goal should be to create enjoyable roleplay experiences for all parties involved.

## No Nonsense Policy

We're all here to roleplay realistically. By entering our server, you are agreeing to play with a character / personality that has a decent backstory. It also means that you're agreeing to the understanding that when you begin a roleplay scenario, whatever that roleplay may be, that it should include a reason for existing; in other words, you could explain from start to finish exactly why the roleplay has been initiated, what reasons your character has for being apart of the roleplay, what the end goal of that roleplay is, and how your character's personality / existence ties into the nature of the roleplay. 

Examples of breaking the no-nonsense policy:

Wearing "Call of Duty" outfits as civilians for no realistic reason

Robbing a 24/7 in a small town driving a car worth$100k plus

Getting out your car on a simple traffic stop and just hitting a Police Officers

## Character Building

It is recommended at all times to have a character story. This helps maintain realism and provide an enjoyable RP for all. This can be done through the following:

__Characteristics & Traits__

Character traits help create a personality for whom you are playing, and help depict what acts you will and won't commit, Examples of Traits:

!!! success "Good Traits"
    - Loyalty
    - Kindness
    - Integrity
    - Generosity
    - Self-control
    - Patience
    - Tolerance

    __Dark Traits__
   
    - Rudeness
    - Greed
    - Selfishness
    - Unforgiving

__Character's Purpose__

Your character should have a purpose in life with a consistent or developing story.

Example: Don't have a single character who is simultaneously the CEO of a company and a homeless drug user.

__Story__

Develop your character over time, start off with small things, whether your character has good or dark traits. Work your way up to bigger and better things, rather than doing major jumps in a couple of hours. Developing your character helps create a history within the CAD System and a known/recognized name around Hall County. This is crucial for realism. 

Examples:

!!! success "Subject A"

    Is a positive guy he moves to San Andreas with 1000$ in his pocket, he makes a roadside mechanic shop and daily went to work, due to his positive vibe a lot of customers came and got jobs done from him. After a couple of months, he gained enough money from profit in his roadside mechanic shop and leased out a building off of Route 68, continuing to develop his career as a mechanic.

!!! failure "Subject B"

    Starts to run a dealership in Gainesville from the money he invented, he then starts to kill his customers if they have blonde hair, eventually becoming a serial killer. But at the same time he becomes a chef at a restaurant and poisons people, he robs shops and banks during his spare time and even robbed his own dealership.

!!! warning "Suicide RP"

    Should be a decision/story which is developed over time. It cannot be used to escape from RP.

## Criminal Story

__Developing and Buidling Crime__

We understand that you enjoy doing criminal activities but we advise you not to commit large scale criminal activities when you first join the server. Build your way up to bigger crime, start off with small crimes such as pickpocketing or shoplifting, and then work your way up to bigger crimes like burglarizing items from vehicles, breaking into houses, etc. It is recommended to have contacts/connections and to thoroughly plan out these crimes.

__Aquiring Clothing, Items, Weapons__

Try to roleplay acquiring equipment that gets used in a crime, such as finding dealers or stores to get weapons, get items to help open doors, break windows, clothes, etc.. This allows for more detailed RP, and gives other players an opportunity to help aid in the RP by providing equipment/supplies.

Dress appropriately for the crime and realistically based on your resources. __Dressing in tens-of-thousands of dollars worth of full tactical, military, or special forces gear to commit a robbery is unrealistic. Criminals wear street clothes, not military gear.__

---

## Gangs / Mafias / Businesses

Gang RP is not allowed unless the gang is within the GHRP gang system.

A gang is defined as a group of individuals whos members collectively identify themselves by adopting a group identity, which they use to create and atmosphere of fear or intimidation, frequently by employing one more of the following: a common name, slogan, identifying sign, symbol, tattoo or other physical marking, style or color of clothing, hairstyle, hand sign or graffiti. Whose purpose in part is to engage in criminal activity and which uses violence or intimidation to further its criminal objectives.

Additional rules pertaining to gangs can be found at __"link gangs documents!"__

Gang wars are to be fought between criminal gangs. Do not declare war against a business group like a towing company unless they are a front for a criminal organization. 

Businesses must be realistic with an RP purpose. 

!!! danger "Gang, Business, or Organizations are ___NOT___ permitted to create affiliated discord servers."

---

## Random Deathmatch / Vehicle Deathmatch

RDM/VDM is the act of killing or running over a player for __no reason randomly with no intention to roleplaying the incident.__ Prior interaction with a player and a __valid exchange__ must be established before you can kill someone. Vehicle Deathmatching is only allowed if the other person poses a threat or has had a prior interaction with the player. 

Example of RDM vs a valid exchange:

!!! failure "Subject A walks up to Subject B who he/she has never interacted with and shoots Subject B."

!!! success "Subject A has a prior interaction with Subject B where Subject B had assaulted his wife at a store. Subject B fled and then continued to harass his wife online and gave no apology even while Subject A had threatened him violently. Finally Subject A meets Subject B and shoots him."

Example of VDM vs a valid exchange:

!!! failure "Subject A runs over Subject B in his Toyota Prius then drives off as nothing happened."

!!! success "Subject A is sitting in his Toyota Prius vibing to some music. When Subject B appears wielding a knife in front of his vehicle. Subject A locks his doors. Subject B tries to break his windshield using the knife. Subject A floors the Prius to get out of the location and runs over Subject B in the process, then calls 911."

---

## Meta Gaming

This is when you utilize __Out-Of-Character information/knowledge for personal In-Character benefit or gain.__ Even if it doesn't put you at an advantage, mixing OOC with IC will be considered Meta Gaming. Only use the information/knowledge you received IC.

This includes any information gained from external programs such as __Discord, Twitch Streams, OOC Chat.__

All radio channels are encrypted. Using police scanners by sitting in RTO, going to 911 calls, being "clocked in" in-game, which gives you access to police blips, menus, and 911 calls is metagaming, unless you are an authorized LEO playing on your real LEO character. 

Example of Meta Gaming:

- Subject A goes to Subject B's twitch stream and uses it to find the location of Subject B to kill him.

- Fleeing from the police as soon as the priority-cooldown timer expires for no reason other than to cause a pursuit. In other words, fleeing for no legitimate reason. If your character is committing an offence which would potentially result in an arrest, it would be a justifiable reason to flee. The action needs to make sense in your character's roleplay; magically willing 500 pounds of cocaine into existence in your trunk through a /do or /me as an excuse to justify fleeing as opposed to it being a part of your roleplay (I.E. as a drug trafficker) is not permitted.

---

## Power Gaming

The following are prohibited:

Depicting another player's actions without them agreeing to it, or doing it themselves.

Declaring that your actions against another player were successful without allowing them the opportunity to respond (unless they are dead, restrained, or uncapacitated...in which case they cannot resist). 

Forcefully performing an unrealistic action against someone without providing them an opportunity to evade such an action.

Claimable property (Shops, Homes, etc.) on the server is viewed as first-come first-serve. Stating that you legitimately own a property while another player had already legitimately claimed to own the same location for an RP is power-gaming. Government property cannot be claimed by civilians (e.g. airports, police stations, etc.).

!!! example "Examples:"

    After you die, someone searches your dead body and you write "/me A grenade falls out of my pocket and explodes, you all die."

    An officer using a K9 says there are drugs in a car without allowing the driver of the vehicle to do a /me or /do in response to the K9 sniff the vehicle and then being allowed to choose what their character has in the car.

    Typing "/me stabs officer to death" while standing next to a police officer.

    Typing "/me grabs your head and smacks you into a wall."

---

## Breaking Character

You must remain IC at all times while in the server. Breaking character by going OOC should not be happening unless a break-in RP has been initiated while being spoken to an active member of the moderation team.

Choosing to criticize and nitpick minor policy issues of police officers while your character is engaged in heavy-criminal activity is considered unrealistic. (Ex. Your character is being arrested for triple murder and you decide to take the opportunity to ask the officer why their license plate is wrong.)

!!! failure "Saying things such as: "It's lag", "I'm going to report you", "That's not allowed your breaking server rules", "I don't want to roleplay this" etc."

---

## Fear RP

All characters must operate with some level of fear for their lives. While your characters may not truly die, they must act as if their character is subject to fear due to the possibility of being injured or losing their life. You must take into account all repercussions while your life is on the line, you can't be a hero every time.

If an opportunity presents itself where you are not in immediate danger, they may fight back.

Example of Fear RP:

!!! success "Subject A is in an alleyway with 4 gang members who all have guns pointed towards him/her. Subject A follows all demands and stays co-operative due to fear for his life."

---

## New Life Rule

If your character gets hurt and dies, the moment they respawn after the timer ends they must forget everything that has led up to the moment, this means you must roleplay it out that your lost your memory or forgot what happened and cannot return back to the scene for revenge. You may also not continue conducting the exact same type of roleplay as before as this defeats the purpose of the rule (ex. Your character dies in a massive car accident or pursuit following a robbery...you should not be back on the street 5 minutes later doing the exact same thing). 

Your character may only be allowed to survive and remember an injury which incapacitated them if an actual player (typically EMS) physically transports you to a hospital where you are treated and recover from your injuries.

---

## Fail RP

This is anything the can be considered an unrealistic situation. This is usually common sense, simply ask yourself these questions: Does this happen IRL? or Would you do this IRL? or Does this match your character's storyline?

--- 

## Interfering

Interfering is prohibited and is defined as when a player forcefully interjects themselves into a different player's RP without meaningful or practical objectives, causing the pre-existing RP to be ruined or the outcome to be changed. However; acting in the capacity of a good Samaritan shall not be considered Interfering.

Example of Interfering:

!!! failure "Subject A is on a scene with officers, Subject B comes up to the traffic stop and kicks the subject's vehicle for no reason and runs off causing the officers to follow."

Example of Good Samaritan:

!!! success Subject A Shoots a police officer, Subject B; a civilian walking along the path draws their personal weapon and shoots Subject A dead and calls for Medical and Police Services.
