## Overview

Welcome to Georgia HEAT Roleplay, "GHRP". We are a semi-realistic FiveM server, but we expect a high level of roleplay. This document lists the rules and guidelines for roleplay, which should be followed to the best of your ability at all times. Failure to meet roleplay expectations as outlined in this document will result in discipline to protect each community members experience. 

Not all rules can be outlined, but you should approach in game interactions with common sense. Your goal should be to create enjoyable roleplay experiences for all parties involved.

- ### Mission Statement

---

## No Nonsense Policy

We're all here to roleplay realistically. By entering our server, you are agreeing to play with a character / personality that has a decent backstory. It also means that you're agreeing to the understanding that when you begin a roleplay scenario, whatever that roleplay may be, that it should include a reason for existing; in other words, you could explain from start to finish exactly why the roleplay has been initiated, what reasons your character has for being apart of the roleplay, what the end goal of that roleplay is, and how your character's personality / existence ties into the nature of the roleplay. 

Examples of breaking the no-nonsense policy:

Wearing "Call of Duty" outfits as civilians for no realistic reason

Robbing a 24/7 in a small town driving a car worth$100k plus

Getting out your car on a simple traffic stop and just hitting a Police Officers

## Character Building

It is recommended at all times to have a character story. This helps maintain realism and provide an enjoyable RP for all. This can be done through the following:

__Characteristics & Traits__

Character traits help create a personality for whom you are playing, and help depict what acts you will and won't commit, Examples of Traits:

!!! success "Good Traits"
    - Loyalty
    - Kindness
    - Integrity
    - Generosity
    - Self-control
    - Patience
    - Tolerance

    __Dark Traits__
   
    - Rudeness
    - Greed
    - Selfishness
    - Unforgiving

__Character's Purpose__

Your character should have a purpose in life with a consistent or developing story.

Example: Don't have a single character who is simultaneously the CEO of a company and a homeless drug user.

__Story__

Develop your character over time, start off with small things, whether your character has good or dark traits. Work your way up to bigger and better things, rather than doing major jumps in a couple of hours. Developing your character helps create a history within the CAD System and a known/recognized name around Hall County. This is crucial for realism. 

Examples:

!!! success "Subject A"

    Is a positive guy he moves to San Andreas with 1000$ in his pocket, he makes a roadside mechanic shop and daily went to work, due to his positive vibe a lot of customers came and got jobs done from him. After a couple of months, he gained enough money from profit in his roadside mechanic shop and leased out a building off of Route 68, continuing to develop his career as a mechanic.

!!! failure "Subject B"

    Starts to run a dealership in Gainesville from the money he invented, he then starts to kill his customers if they have blonde hair, eventually becoming a serial killer. But at the same time he becomes a chef at a restaurant and poisons people, he robs shops and banks during his spare time and even robbed his own dealership.

!!! warning "Suicide RP"

    Should be a decision/story which is developed over time. It cannot be used to escape from RP.

## Criminal Story

__Developing and Buidling Crime__

We understand that you enjoy doing criminal activities but we advise you not to commit large scale criminal activities when you first join the server. Build your way up to bigger crime, start off with small crimes such as pickpocketing or shoplifting, and then work your way up to bigger crimes like burglarizing items from vehicles, breaking into houses, etc. It is recommended to have contacts/connections and to thoroughly plan out these crimes.

__Aquiring Clothing, Items, Weapons__

Try to roleplay acquiring equipment that gets used in a crime, such as finding dealers or stores to get weapons, get items to help open doors, break windows, clothes, etc.. This allows for more detailed RP, and gives other players an opportunity to help aid in the RP by providing equipment/supplies.

Dress appropriately for the crime and realistically based on your resources. __Dressing in tens-of-thousands of dollars worth of full tactical, military, or special forces gear to commit a robbery is unrealistic. Criminals wear street clothes, not military gear.__

## Gangs / Mafias / Businesses

Gang RP is not allowed unless the gang is within the GHRP gang system.

A gang is defined as a group of individuals whos members collectively identify themselves by adopting a group identity, which they use to create and atmosphere of fear or intimidation, frequently by employing one more of the following: a common name, slogan, identifying sign, symbol, tattoo or other physical marking, style or color of clothing, hairstyle, hand sign or graffiti. Whose purpose in part is to engage in criminal activity and which uses violence or intimidation to further its criminal objectives.

Additional rules pertaining to gangs can be found at __"link gangs documents!"__

Gang wars are to be fought between criminal gangs. Do not declare war against a business group like a towing company unless they are a front for a criminal organization. 

Businesses must be realistic with an RP purpose.
